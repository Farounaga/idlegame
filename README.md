# IDLE DAO Prototype

A minimal browser idle-game prototype in a xianxia-inspired setting:
- automatic combat ticks;
- XP, levels, and progression;
- multiple character attributes (Strength, Vitality, Agility, Dexterity, Spirit, Willpower, Luck);
- breakthrough (prestige) with Dao Insight bonuses.

## UI approach
- Minimal custom component-like UI (no Bootstrap).
- Token-based styling inspired by clean systems like Radix UI.

## Run locally

Use any static server, for example:

```bash
python -m http.server 4173
```

Then open `http://localhost:4173`.
